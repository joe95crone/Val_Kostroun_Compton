# Val_Kostroun_Compton
Val @ Cornell's Compton Mathematica Notebooks following the analytical peak brightness derivation by FV Hartemann. Also the code from a Hartemann paper obtained from him.

The C++ code is a 3D time and frequency domain code for ICS based on PRSTAB 7, 060703 (2004).

His two Mathematica scripts look to be slightly incorrect.

However, it is a good demonstration of how to plot the peak using something like this method. Also helpful list of definitions of the sub parameters.

He uses cgs and weird units in this for example the eV/Angstom conversion just hardcoded.
